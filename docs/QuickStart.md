# Quick Start
The library has different modules that can be imported separately
- BigQuery
```
libraryDependencies += "io.github.data-tools" %% "big-data-types-bigquery" % "{version}"
```
- Spark
```
libraryDependencies += "io.github.data-tools" %% "big-data-types-spark" % "{version}"
```
- Cassandra
```
libraryDependencies += "io.github.data-tools" %% "big-data-types-cassandra" % "{version}"
```
- Core
    - To get support for abstract SqlTypes, it is included in the others, so it is not needed if you are using one of the others
```
libraryDependencies += "io.github.data-tools" %% "big-data-types-core" % "{version}"
```
